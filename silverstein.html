      <h1>Silverstein Procedure</h1>

      <p>
        The <a class="link" href="https://www.earrf.org/hyperacusis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silverstein procedure</a>, also known as the round and oval window reinforcement surgery,
        is a surgical technique developed by Dr. Herbert Silverstein as a potential treatment
        for severe hyperacusis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure involves carefully reinforcing the round window
        and sometimes the oval window of the middle ear with soft tissue grafts—typically
        fascia, fat, or perichondrium—to dampen the mechanical transmission of sound vibrations
        entering the inner ear. By partially reducing the movement of these windows, the inner
        ear’s sensitivity to sound energy may be lowered, theoretically decreasing the
        over-amplified perception of sound that characterizes hyperacusis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The surgery is
        performed through the ear canal under local or general anesthesia, and patients
        typically go home the same day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Results from the Silverstein procedure have been mixed but occasionally encouraging.
        Early reports from the Silverstein Institute and a few small case series suggest that
        some patients experience meaningful reductions in loudness sensitivity and improved
        sound tolerance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, outcomes are inconsistent, and the mechanism by which the
        procedure provides relief remains debated. While a subset of patients report long-term
        benefit, others experience only temporary improvement or no change at all. There are
        also potential risks, including hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus changes, or worsening
        sound sensitivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of limited data, small sample sizes, and the absence of
        randomized clinical trials, the Silverstein procedure remains experimental, recommended
        primarily for patients with severe, refractory hyperacusis who have exhausted conservative
        options.
      </p>
      <p>The <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2271375819742791/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperacusis Surgery Talk group</a> on Facebook features numerous real patient experiences and outcomes related to the Silverstein procedure. It serves as a valuable space where individuals discuss their results, recovery journeys, and insights, providing an authentic look into the effectiveness and challenges of this surgical approach.</p>

       <h1>Surgeons Who Have Expertise in the Silverstein Procedure</h1>
       <p>
Locating a specialist qualified to perform the Silverstein procedure can be challenging, as only a limited number of surgeons have received training in this technique. To further complicate matters, individuals with severe hyperacusis may have difficulty traveling, if they are able to travel at all. The <a class="link" href="https://www.earrf.org/fellowship-graduates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ear Research Foundation Fellowship Graduates</a> website provides a list of physicians who trained with Dr. Herbert Silverstein, along with a map of their locations; however, not all of these physicians necessarily perform the Silverstein procedure.
</p>
       <p>
       Below is a list of physicians who are either known to have performed the Silverstein procedure or have indicated that they are willing to perform it. This list is intended to help patients identify qualified practitioners for consultation or treatment.
