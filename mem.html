      <h1>Middle Ear Myoclonus</h1>

      <p>
        Middle ear myoclonus (MEM) involves involuntary, repetitive contractions of the tensor tympani and/or stapedius muscles, sometimes producing
        audible clicking or thumping sounds perceived by the patient or even an examiner. Both conditions are thought to
        arise from heightened central and peripheral auditory reflexes, often following acoustic trauma, stress, or
        prolonged sound sensitivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In individuals with hyperacusis or noxacusis, the auditory system becomes hypersensitized,
        and these protective reflexes can become maladaptive—firing excessively or continuously in response to normal
        environmental sounds. Over time, this can reinforce a cycle of pain, muscle tension, and heightened auditory gain,
        contributing to the persistence and severity of sound-induced discomfort.

      The <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/middleearmyoclonus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">middle ear myoclonus (MEM) support group</a> on Facebook offers a community where individuals can share their experiences, discuss symptoms, and explore treatment outcomes. It provides a space for members to connect with others facing similar challenges and to exchange valuable information about managing and understanding the condition.

      <h1>Tonic Tensor Tympani Syndrome</h1>

      <p>
        Tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) and middle ear myoclonus (MEM) are involuntary muscle disorders of the middle ear
        that can closely overlap with, or develop secondary to, hyperacusis and noxacusis. 
      </p>

      <p>In TTTS, the tensor tympani
        muscle—which normally contracts reflexively in response to loud sounds—becomes overactive or persistently tense,
        often triggered by even moderate noises or anticipation of sound. This chronic contraction can cause sensations
        of fullness, fluttering, pressure, or pain deep in the ear, and may exacerbate sound intolerance by increasing
        mechanical tension on the eardrum and ossicles.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/503100723229728/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tonic tensor tympani support group</a> is a Facebook community which focuses on discussions, personal experiences, and treatment outcomes related to tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). This group provides a supportive environment where members can share insights, coping strategies, and information to help better understand and manage this complex condition.
