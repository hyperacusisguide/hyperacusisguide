  <h1>Hyperacusis & Noxacusis</h1>

  <p>Hyperacusis is a condition characterized by an abnormally heightened sensitivity to everyday sounds that are typically well tolerated by others. People with hyperacusis may perceive normal environmental noises—such as running water, clinking dishes, or voices—as uncomfortably loud or intrusive. This reaction does not stem from hearing loss but from a dysregulation within the auditory system, where sound processing pathways become overly reactive. The condition often follows acoustic trauma, prolonged noise exposure, otologic injury, or neurological dysfunction, and it can vary widely in severity. For many individuals, hyperacusis causes distress, anxiety, and social withdrawal as they attempt to avoid environments that provoke discomfort. Proper management focuses on protecting against harmful sound exposure while gradually reintroducing tolerable sounds in a controlled, stable environment to help restore auditory tolerance.</p>
  <p>Noxacusis is a severe, pain-associated form of hyperacusis in which certain sounds not only feel intolerably loud but also produce physical pain in the ears or surrounding areas. This pain may manifest as burning, stabbing, or pressure sensations, and it can persist or worsen after sound exposure—a phenomenon known as delayed ear pain. Noxacusis is believed to involve damage or sensitization of the cochlear nerve fibers and pain-transmitting pathways, leading to a maladaptive pain response to normal sound levels. Even moderate noises such as conversation, traffic, or running appliances can provoke intense discomfort, making daily functioning extremely difficult. Because noxacusis can rapidly progress and lead to debilitating sound intolerance, early recognition and strict noise control are critical. Creating a safe, predictable sound environment can prevent further injury and allow gradual stabilization of symptoms over time.</p></article>
